```
✏ Rename `.env.example` to `.env` in the main folder and provide your `appId` and `serverUrl` from Moralis ([How to start Moralis Server](https://docs.moralis.io/moralis-server/getting-started/create-a-moralis-server))

```

🔃 Sync the `MarketItemCreated` event `/src/contracts/marketplac.sol` contract with your Moralis Server, making the tableName `MarketItems`
